    2) Convert a float to an int
    3) Perform floor division using a float and an int.
    4) Use two user inputted values to perform multiplication.

    Take note of what information is lost when some conversions take place.

'''
a = float(2)
print(a)
b = int(2.2)
print(b)
c = 200 // 3.3
print(c)
d = int(input("choose a number: "))
e = int(input("choose another number: "))
f = d * e
print("the product of your numbers is: " + str(f))2
